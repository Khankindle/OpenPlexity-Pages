## Early Life: The Future of AI

The concept of Artificial Intelligence (AI) has been around for centuries, with ancient Greeks and Romans exploring the idea of creating machines that could think and act like humans [1]. The term "Artificial Intelligence" was first coined in 1956 by computer scientist John McCarthy, who organized the Dartmouth Summer Research Project on Artificial Intelligence [2]. This project aimed to explore the possibilities of creating machines that could simulate human intelligence, and it marked the beginning of AI as a field of research [3]. As AI continued to evolve, researchers began to develop the first AI programs, including the Logical Theorist, which was designed to simulate human problem-solving abilities [4].
