Mark Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York, to Edward and Karen Zuckerberg [1]. He developed an interest in computers and programming at a young age and attended Phillips Exeter Academy before enrolling at Harvard University in 2002 [2]. During his sophomore year at Harvard, Zuckerberg created a website called "Facemash" that allowed users to compare the photos of two students and vote on which one was more attractive [3]. However, the site became popular and also generated controversy, leading to Zuckerberg facing charges and eventually dropping the site [4].
