Mark Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York, and raised in Dobbs Ferry, New York [1]. He co-created Facebook in his Harvard College dorm room in 2004, a platform that would eventually become the world's largest social networking site [2]. Zuckerberg's early success with Facebook led him to drop out of Harvard in 2005 to focus on the company full-time [3]. He later returned to Harvard in 2017 to give the commencement speech and receive an honorary degree, a testament to his perseverance and dedication to his craft [4].
