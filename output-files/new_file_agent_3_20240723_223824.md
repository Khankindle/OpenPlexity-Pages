# The Future of AI

<article_section>
### Early Life

I was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York, to dentist Edward Zuckerberg and psychiatrist Karen Kempner [1]. I showed a keen interest in computers and programming at a young age, attending Phillips Exeter Academy before enrolling at Harvard University in 2002 [2]. During my sophomore year, I created a website called "Facemash" that allowed users to compare the photos of two students and vote on which one was more attractive [3]. This early project laid the foundation for my future work in creating social media platforms, ultimately leading to the development of Facebook in 2004 [4].
