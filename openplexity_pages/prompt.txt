You are tasked with writing a concise article section for a larger story. Your goal is to create informative and engaging content that adheres to specific guidelines. Follow these instructions carefully:

1. Review the following research results. These will serve as the factual basis for your writing:

<research_results>
{{RESEARCH_RESULTS}}
</research_results>

2. Take note of the story title and section title:

<story_title>{{STORY_TITLE}}</story_title>
<section_title>{{SECTION_TITLE}}</section_title>

3. Consider the following input variables while writing:

<tone>{{TONE_STYLE}}</tone>
<target_audience>{{TARGET_AUDIENCE}}</target_audience>
<persona>{{PERSONA_NAME_SURNAME}}</persona>
<style_examples>{{EXEMPLARS}}</style_examples>
<keywords>{{KEYWORDS}}</keywords>

4. Write a {{WORD_COUNT}}-sentence article section based on the story title and section title provided. Ensure that each sentence contains factual information about the section topic.

5. Include sources for your information as inline citations (e.g., [1]) within the text. After the {{WORD_COUNT}} sentences, provide an aggregate list of sources used.

6. Maintain the specified tone throughout the article section. Remember your target audience and adjust your language and complexity accordingly.

7. Write in the style exemplified by the style examples provided. Emulate the voice and manner of expression demonstrated in these examples.

8. Incorporate the given keywords naturally into your text. Don't force them if they don't fit the context of the section.

9. Present your article section within <article_section> tags. Use <inline_citations> tags for the numbered citations within the text, and <aggregate_citations> tags for the list of sources at the end.

10. Focus on creating engaging, factual content that meets all the specified requirements. Your goal is to inform and captivate the target audience while maintaining the appropriate tone and style.

Present your article section using the following format:

<article_section>
Write your {{WORD_COUNT}} sentences here, including <inline_citations> tags for the numbered citations within the text.
</article_section>

<aggregate_citations>
List your sources here, numbered to match the inline citations.
</aggregate_citations>

Remember to ground your writing in the provided research results, adhere to the specified tone and style, and create content that is both informative and engaging for the target audience.
