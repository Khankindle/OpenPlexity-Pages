# Early Life

I was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York, to Karen and Edward Zuckerberg [1]. Growing up in the nearby town of Dobbs Ferry, I developed an interest in computers and programming at a young age, which was encouraged by my parents [2]. I attended Phillips Exeter Academy before enrolling at Harvard University in 2002, where I studied computer science and psychology [3]. Although I didn't have any direct connections to China or Mars, or even know Elon Musk at the time, my early life experiences laid the foundation for my future endeavors in technology and innovation [4].
