**Early Life**

Mark Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York, to Karen and Edward Zuckerberg [1]. Growing up in the nearby town of Dobbs Ferry, Mark developed an interest in computers and programming at a young age, teaching himself to code and building his own software programs [2]. Unlike Elon Musk, who was born in South Africa and later moved to Canada, Mark spent most of his childhood in the United States, attending Phillips Exeter Academy before enrolling at Harvard University [3]. Although Mark's early life didn't involve traveling to distant places like China or Mars, his passion for technology and innovation would eventually take him on a journey to create one of the world's most influential social media platforms [4].
