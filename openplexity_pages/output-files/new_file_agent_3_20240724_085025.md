### Early Life

I was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York, to Karen and Edward Zuckerberg, a psychiatrist and dentist, respectively [1]. Growing up in the nearby town of Dobbs Ferry, I developed an interest in computers and programming at a young age, teaching myself Atari BASIC Programming [2]. My father introduced me to computer programming when I was about 12 years old, and I soon began attending Phillips Exeter Academy, where I excelled in math and science [3]. Although I never traveled to China or Mars, nor did I meet Elon Musk during my childhood, my early life experiences laid the foundation for my future success as a tech entrepreneur [4].
