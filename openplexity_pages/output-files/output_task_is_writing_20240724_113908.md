## Mark Zuckerberg: Early Life

Mark Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York[1]. He developed an interest in computers and programming at an early age and began attending Phillips Exeter Academy[2]. While still in high school, Mark co-created a music player called Synapse and was even approached by companies like AOL and Microsoft[3]. His passion for technology eventually led him to attend Harvard University, where he studied computer science and met his future college roommates and fellow Facebook co-founders Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz, and Chris Hughes[4].
