## Early Life: Mark Zuckerberg

Mark Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York, to Karen and Edward Zuckerberg [1]. Growing up in the nearby town of Dobbs Ferry, Mark developed an interest in computers and programming at a young age, which was encouraged by his father, a dentist [2]. Mark's early life was marked by a strong emphasis on education, and he attended Phillips Exeter Academy before enrolling at Harvard University in 2002 [3]. During his sophomore year at Harvard, Mark created a website called "Facemash" that allowed users to compare the photos of two students and vote on which one was more attractive [4].
