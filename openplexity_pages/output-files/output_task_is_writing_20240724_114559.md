## Mark Zuckerberg: Early Life

Mark Zuckerberg was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York, into a comfortable, well-educated family [1]. He was raised in the nearby village of Dobbs Ferry, New York, where his father, Edward Zuckerberg, ran a dental practice attached to the family home [2]. Mark's early life was marked by a strong interest in computers and programming, which was encouraged by his father, who taught him Atari BASIC Programming [4]. As a young boy, Mark used this knowledge to create a messaging program called "ZuckNet" when he was about 12 years old [4].
