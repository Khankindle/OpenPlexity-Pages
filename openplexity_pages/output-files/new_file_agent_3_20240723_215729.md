# Early Life

I was born on May 14, 1984, in White Plains, New York, to Karen and Edward Zuckerberg [1]. Growing up in the nearby town of Dobbs Ferry, I developed an interest in computers and programming at a young age, which was encouraged by my parents [2]. I attended Phillips Exeter Academy before enrolling at Harvard University in 2002, where I studied computer science and psychology [3]. Although I didn't have any direct connections to China or Mars, or interactions with Elon Musk during my early life, my experiences during this time laid the foundation for my future endeavors [4].
